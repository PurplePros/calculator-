Description: A working calculator that calculates arithmetic expressions following BEDMAS. 

Welcome to my first project! I started picking up Java again, and to put what I've learned to use, I decided to program a calculator. The program uses Java Swing for GUI. The actual calculation itself is done in the class Calculator, which implements the shunting-yard algorithm. It begins by converting the user's inputted expression, which is in infix notation, into a postfix notation that can be easily evaluated. 

Next steps are to handle exceptions and errors.
